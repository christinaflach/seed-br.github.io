### Teaching with OSS

> The need to reconcile theory and practice, using "real-world" scenarios to stimulate the improvement of technical and soft skills
is demanding for Software Engineering (SE) and Computer Science Education.

> Previous experience

### Open Source Software (OSS)

The availability of source code and the access to its community and development workflows are appealing factors for adopting OSS in SEE.

</section>

We report our latest experience with OSS-based
learning in a SE course entitled Topics in Software Engineering (TSE).

<!-- -------------------------------- -->
<section>
### Challenges

- reconcile theory with practice (evolving
software in social coding platforms) while planning to address
previously reported barriers of OSS-based learning.

- Not a mandatory SE course

### Course Design

#### Learning outcomes

- Understand Open Source Software concepts and practices.
- Characterize OSS projects regarding its features, history and context, newcomers' support and social conventions, socio-technical practices and deliverables.
- Select OSS projects to work with based on their domain and other characteristics.
- Understand aspects related contributing to OSS projects.

### Recommendations from the Trenches

- Hands-on activities are the core of the course: recruit at least
one teaching assistant with experience in OSS development.
- Promote open communication: define communication chan-
nels early and use them effectively.
- Decide on a control strategy to use early in the course (in-
ternal or external projects).
- Plan to be flexible.
- Plan and communicate the syllabus early, leaving room
for last-minute, on-the-fly modifications.
- Survey the students’ knowledge and previous experience
with OSS and adjust the course plan, if necessary.
(5) Select suitable OSS projects.
- Define criteria, filter and select a set of small OSS projects
to use as internal learning objects.
- Double-check the OSS project for welcome messages and
guidelines for newcomers.
- Mentor students in selecting an OSS project to contribute.
- Share early and share often: share journal entries and stu-
dents’ progress, and promote frequent discussions.
- Invite keynotes to share their expertise and present talks
about software licenses, continuous SE, social aspects of OSS,
among other topics.
