# About 

## What's in a name?
 
SEED stands for "when Software Ecosystems and Software Engineering EDucation collide". 
The mediator is Open Source Software. 
We've started this journey with some old & shared "itches", new challenges and new friends. 
We've embraced them.

## What's in a picture?

SEED is _semente_ in Portuguese.
The single still logo conveys the essence of our group.

## Where did we come from?

Our former research group, [aside@ufba](http://aside.dcc.ufba.br/) (software design and evolution) 
was born in 2003 and has itself evolved.
After 18 years, we needed a new name, goals and clothes. 
We needed a new research group.
We are very grateful to all collaborators and friends that joined the aside@ufba group.
