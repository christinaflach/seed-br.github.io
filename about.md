# About 

## seed.br
 
SEED stands for "when Software Ecosystems and Software Engineering EDucation collide". 
The mediator is Open Source Software. 
We've started this journey in 2011 with some old&shared "itches" and new challenges added to our research agenda. 
We had to embrace them.

Our former research group, [aside@ufba](http://aside.dcc.ufba.br/) (software design and evolution) has evolved, 
and we needed a new name, mission, goals and clothes. 
We needed a new research group.
