## Origins

Our research group, formerly [aside@ufba](http://aside.dcc.ufba.br/), 
was born in 2003 with the goal of
investigating topics related to software design and evolution. 
Over 18 years, the group itself has evolved. 
SEED brings new challenges, goals and clothes. 

## Former Members

We are very grateful to everyone that joined our group, 
either __aside@ufba__ or __SEED__,
and enjoyed themselves while working together.
We embrace you all.

We've started this journey with some old & shared "itches" and new challenges. 
We've started this journey in 2003.
Our research group gathers people with shared _itches_ and _beliefs_ 
that work (and enjoy themselves while working) with software and people.
