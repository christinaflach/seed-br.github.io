### What's in a name?
 
**SEED** stands for "when Software Ecosystems and Software Engineering EDucation collide". 
The mediator is Open Source Software. 
We've started this journey with some old & shared "itches", 
new challenges and new friends. We've embraced them.

### What's in a picture?

SEED is _semente_ in Portuguese.
The single still logo conveys the essence of our group.

### Where did we come from?

Our former research group [aside@ufba](http://aside.dcc.ufba.br/) 
born in 2003,
investigated topics related to software design and evolution, 
After 18 years, it has itself evolved. 
We needed a new name, goals and clothes. 

### Former members

We are very grateful to all collaborators and friends i
that joined and contributed to the aside@ufba group.
