## Our Group
 
SEED stands for "when Software Ecosystems and Software Engineering EDucation collide". 
And the mediator is Open Source Software.

Our research group gathers people that work (and enjoy themselves while working) with software and people.


## Our Beliefs

+ Software exists for the benefit of people.
+ Software requires effort and intelligence from people to create software that is useful to people. 
+ Useful software is constantly evolving. 
+ Software has essential and accidental issues related to software practices and software people.
+ Education and collaboration must be pervasive to software ecosystems.
