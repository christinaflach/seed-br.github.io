## SEED

SEED stands for ```when _S_oftware _E_cosystems and 
Software Engineering _ED_ucation collide". 
The mediator is Open Source Software.```

We've started this journey in 2003.
Our research group gathers people with shared _itches_ and _beliefs_ 
that work (and enjoy themselves while working) with software and people.


## Our Beliefs

   (1) Software exists for the benefit of people. 

   (2) Software design requires effort and intelligence from people to create software that is useful to people.

   (3) Useful software is constantly evolving.

   (4) Software has essential and accidental issues related to software itself, practices and people.

   (5) Education, Openness and Collaboration must be pervasive to software ecosystems.
