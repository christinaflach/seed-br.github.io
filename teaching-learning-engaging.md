# Teaching, Learning and Engaging in Free/Libre/Open Source Software Projects

There is an increasing interest in FLOSS-based learning, that is, adopting practices of the open-source development model in Software Engineering Education.
We adapted an existing course design and delivered a “hands-on” course to introduce students to open source software ecosystems and their socio-technical practices.
In this paper, we present the course design and provide a reflection based on the students' feedback and our own experiences about the benefits, difficulties, and challenges in preparing for future implementations of the course.
We hope our lessons learned to inspire educators who may be interested in adopting and adapting the course design and implementation in their institutions, and foster engagement and contributions
to open source software projects.
